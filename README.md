# Superstore Sales Dashboard

### *Project Summary*

The Superstore sales dashboard utilized a Kaggle dataset to find business insights about sales and profit. The Sample Superstore Sales dataset provides sales data for the United States, including information on products, orders, and customers. The data was initially in denormalized form, underwent normalization, and was transformed into four tables: dimCustomer, dimProducts, dimShip, and factSales. Data preprocessing was done to ensure that the data was free from errors and ready for analysis. Irrelevant columns were removed, and the error in the date format was also handled effectively. A new dimDate table was created that contained all dates, and then additional date-related columns were generated. A measures table was also created to consolidate all measures.Data modeling was done to establish one-to-many relationships between the factSales table and the dimension tables, resulting in a star schema.Time intelligence functions were also utilized in our analysis that enable us to manipulate data using time periods, including days, months, quarters, and years,and compare calculations over those periods. The resulting dashboard featured various visualizations including bar charts,pie chart, cards, tables, area chart tool tip, slicers and filters. The superstore sales analysis project aimed to provide insights about sales and profit over years across product categories, segments, and regions. The insights that have been found from the dashboard will be helpful in making business and strategic decisions.


### *Problem Statement*

### *DAX Expressions Used*
The DAX Expressions used for creating measures in the Measure Table are:
* *Total sales = CALCULATE(SUM(factSales[Sales]))*
  
* *YTD Sales = TOTALYTD([Total sales],'dimDate'[Date])*
  
* *LY YTD Sales = COALESCE(CALCULATE(TOTALYTD([Total sales],'dimDate'[Date]),SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('dimDate'[Date])),0)*
  
* *YTD sales Growth % = CALCULATE(DIVIDE(([YTD Sales]-[LY YTD Sales]),[LY YTD Sales],0))*

Where,   
YTD sales - Year-to-date sales   
LY YTD Sales - Last Year-to-date sales
       
DAX Expressions used for creating columns in Date table are:

* *Date = CALENDAR(MIN(factSales[Order Date]),MAX(factSales[Order Date]))*
  
* *Year = FORMAT(dimDate[Date],"yyyy")*
  
* *Month = FORMAT(dimDate[Date],"mmmm")*
  
* *Month year = FORMAT('dimDate'[Date],"MMM-YY")*
  
* *Quarter = "Q" & QUARTER(dimDate[Date])*
  
* *Month Number = Month(dimDate[Date])*
